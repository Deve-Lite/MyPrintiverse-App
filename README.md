### About The Project

***MyPrintiverse*** is simple mobile application mainly created for 3D geeks with few 3D printers. Application allows user to note filaments and spools.
Application was planned to have more modules than noting filaments and login, but we planned too much with small team and idea surpassed us.
Also main idea was that users can use it without having account so some services are complex.

***Course Project***

Before we started with our first 2 modules we made <a href="https://github.com/Deve-Lite/MyPrintiverse-App/tree/main/MyPrintiverse/MyPrintiverse.Core"> MyPrintiverse.Core </a>. It is smaller project where we created base for our application, like base ViewModels, Validations, Services, Interfaces etc. 
After we finished 'Core' we started to develop Authorization and Filament Module. And this is the moment where we stopped working for several reasons.

First of all team was tired of this project already we made a lot of conceptual work and unfortunelty didin't realised that.

Next reason was that .NET MAUI wasn't ready at that time, when we first started to develop appliaction, framework had (still has) a lot of bugs and that was also a bit depressing. Key things wasn't working and because of that we couldn't go forward. That's why our work isn't connected and we have 2 main branches (except main).

***Feature-Filament-2***

This branch contains working version of filament note with searching in list - made by Łukasz Kolber.

***feature/AuthorizationViews***

This branch contains login flow - made by Kacper Żabiński.

***Backend***

Project had working backend written in node.js. Yet unfortunetly backend wasn't well tested.
